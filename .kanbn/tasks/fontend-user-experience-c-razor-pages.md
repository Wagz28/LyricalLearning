# Fontend & User Experience (C# Razor Pages)

I'm thinking we could have it so you upload the lyrics text, then it breaks it down and asks for the translation of each lyric/sentence/paragraph. That would make it easy to create the original database but also a nice addition of usability which has space to be scaled to API translation.

## Sub-tasks

- [ ] Display lyrics & user input fields
- [ ] Provide real-time feedback (wrong/correct)
- [ ] Progress bar for completion
- [ ] List of most Frequent mistakes?
- [ ] Display user performance graphs in UI - hopefully
