# Project Phases

An idea for overarching focuses as given you are more focused on the C# aspect but of course not restricted to it I thought I could do the same with some light Data Analytics integration given we will have at the least basic user accounts, though ofc security and personalisation can be scaled later or never depending.

Also thinking about using SQL, which I have experience in already - very basic language, to set up a database but then there was also the flatfiles - I would love input on your thoughts on this.

  I would love us to make full use of comments, progress tracker (0.8 = 80% etc), due date, task assignments etc.
